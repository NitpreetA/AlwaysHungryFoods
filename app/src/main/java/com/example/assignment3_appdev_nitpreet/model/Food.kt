/*
Model UI And Testing are different tasks done (WBS)

Model Expected time was 2 hours
Model Total time needed was 1 hour and 5 minutes

UI Expected 4-5 Hours
Ui Spent approximately  12 hours
Main issues:
I spent a couple of days on trying to do something that didn't work (Splash screen)
And tiny trip ups that cause delays such as the scaffold issue

 Lastly Testing:
 Time took 45 minutes Expected an hour
 This was just me spending time trying different emulators and different apis to see if the content
 fit on the screen. A couple of issues with the cart info not saving and the content in the card
 not fitting in the container.

 Total time around 14 hours if  not including splash screen (~9 hours)
